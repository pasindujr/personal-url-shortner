# Personal URL Shortner
This is to roll my own short URLs (Sometimes those URLs are actually not short ðŸ˜‰, I just created this and connected a domain I own for the fun and that's all.) 
I used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy this. You can read the full blog post on how to create and deploy this, [here](https://pasindujr.me/blog/personal-url-shortner/) (It's really simple.)
